hello world repository description
Hi everyone, this is my first change to the readme file that is in the branch named readme-edits, each branch opens a new "copy" of the main branch and I can work here without affect the files that are on the main branch.
then when I coose commit, then I must write a commit message that allows everyone to see a general idea of the changes that i have made.
